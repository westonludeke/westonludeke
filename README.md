## Hello World! I'm Weston ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer based in Houston, Texas. I have over a decade of tech industry experience, including at multiple VC-backed Silicon Valley startups

Recently, I built [Campfire](https://campfire-previews.github.io), an open-source, self-hosted deploy preview solution for containerized, headless frontends
