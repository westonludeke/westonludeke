## Hey, I'm Weston üëã  

10+ years in startups working at the intersection of users and engineers.

First customer-facing hire at Pythagora (YC W24). Owned everything user facing: support, marketing, social media, documentation + READMEs, youtube demos, influencer campaigns, built full-stack demo applications, wrote blog posts, etc.

Before that, I spent 7 years at Streak (YC S11) doing technical support and internal tooling. I mentored teammates, ran 1:1s, led interviews and onboarding, and built automation workflows using SQL, BigQuery, APIs, and Zapier. I worked closely with product and engineering to shape roadmap decisions based on user feedback.

I thrive in early-stage environments working directly with founders, and I love getting hands-on with code.

### üß† Projects

I also [wrote the technical case study](https://campfire-previews.github.io).

- **[Ragtime](https://github.com/westonludeke/ragtime)** ‚Äì A minimalist internal RAG chatbot built with JavaScript, Chroma, and OpenAI. Designed to help engineers query technical documentation using natural language.
