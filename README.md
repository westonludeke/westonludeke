## Hey, I'm Weston üëã  

I'm a technical operator with 10+ years in the tech industry and leadership experience across customer-facing teams. Most recently, I was the first customer-facing hire at Pythagora (YC W24), where I built and led the company‚Äôs DevRel, support, documentation, and community efforts.

I build tools, write docs, and help developers become power users.

Before Pythagora, I developed [Campfire](https://campfire-previews.github.io), an open-source tool for self-hosted CI/CD preview environments. It lets team members comment directly on deploy previews and streamlines cross-functional feedback.
