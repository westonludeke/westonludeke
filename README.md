##### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Weston Ludeke and I'm currently learning computer programming. By day I work at Streak doing support, helping our customers and communicating bug reports between our clients and our engineering team.

During my free time I'm a student at Launch School using the Ruby language to learn software engineering.
