Hello World! My name is Weston Ludeke and I'm a software engineer. 

### About Me

Beginning in January 2020, I was a student at [Launch School](https://launchschool.com) where I utilized the techniques of Mastery Based Learning to help me along the road towards mastery of the fundamentals of software engineering. After 1700+ hours of studying over 3.5 years while still working at my day job, I finished Launch Schoolâ€™s core curriculum in summer 2023. Today, Iâ€™m proficient in Javascript, Mongo, Express, React, JSX, Node, Ruby, Sinatra, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, Postgres, APIs, & Google Apps Script.
