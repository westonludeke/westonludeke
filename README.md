## Hello World! I'm Weston ðŸ‘‹ 

Beginning in January 2020, I was a student at [Launch School](https://launchschool.com) where I utilized the techniques of Mastery Based Learning to help me along the road towards mastery of the fundamentals of software engineering. After 1700+ hours of studying over 3.5 years while still working at my day job, I finished Launch Schoolâ€™s core curriculum in summer 2023.
