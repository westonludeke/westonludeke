## Hello World! I'm Weston ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for lifelong learning and growth. I've worked in the tech industry for more than a decade at small VC-backed startups in Silicon Valley as well as at large publicly traded companies.

Prior to learning software engineering, I worked in customer-facing roles such as Support, Account Management, and Sales. In these customer roles, I spent many years serving as a liaison between customers and engineering teams, translating engineer-speak to customers and vice-versa.

When I'm not in front of the computer, I'm most likely reading a book or learning languages.
